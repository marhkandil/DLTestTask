# Deep Learning Test Task
Classifying Ciphar-10 dataset using LeNet-5 Architecture

*Disclaimer:* 
I obtained the code that generates the visualizing the filters from Keras's guide : 
`https://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html`

As for the function that plots out the accuracy and loss against the epochs, I got it from:
`http://parneetk.github.io/blog/cnn-cifar10/`

I implemented the model using Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree's code as a guide
